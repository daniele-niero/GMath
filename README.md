# Overview #

GMath is a math ~~templated~~ library written in C++ with Python wrappers made with ~~Boost::Python~~ [SWIG](http://www.swig.org/).

It has been designed with Computer Graphic technical directors in mind, especially Character TDs.
It's primary goal is not to be super fast (although it's not slow) but to be easy to understand and use.
